\section{Adversarial nets}
The adversarial modeling framework is most straightforward to apply when the models are both multilayer perceptrons.
To learn the generator’s distribution pg over data x, we define a prior on input noise variables $p_z (z)$, 
then represent a mapping to data space as $G(z; \theta g )$, where G is a
differentiable function represented by a multilayer perceptron with parameters $\theta_g$ . We also define a
second multilayer perceptron $D(x; \theta d)$ that outputs a single scalar. $D(x)$ represents the probability
that x came from the data rather than pg . We train D to maximize the probability of assigning the
correct label to both training examples and samples from G. We simultaneously train G to minimize
$\log(1 - D(G(z)))$:


In other words, D and G play the following two-player minimax game with value function V (G, D):

\[
    \min_{G} \max_{D} V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}}[\log D(x))] 
    + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_z(z)}[\log(1-D(G(z)))]
    \label{eqn1}
\]

\noindent
In the next section, we present a theoretical analysis of adversarial nets, essentially showing that
the training criterion allows one to recover the data generating distribution as G and D are given
enough capacity, i.e., in the non-parametric limit. See Figure 1 for a less formal, more pedagogical
explanation of the approach. In practice, we must implement the game using an iterative, numerical
approach. Optimizing D to completion in the inner loop of training is computationally prohibitive,
and on finite datasets would result in overfitting. Instead, we alternate between k steps of optimizing
D and one step of optimizing G. This results in D being maintained near its optimal solution, so
long as G changes slowly enough. This strategy is analogous to the way that SML/PCD [31, 29]
training maintains samples from a Markov chain from one learning step to the next in order to avoid
burning in a Markov chain as part of the inner loop of learning. The procedure is formally presented
in Algorithm 1.

\noindent
In practice, equation 1 may not provide sufficient gradient for G to learn well. Early in learning,
when G is poor, D can reject samples with high confidence because they are clearly different from
the training data. In this case, $\log(1 - D(G(z)))$ saturates. Rather than training G to minimize
$\log(1 - D(G(z)))$ we can train G to maximize log $D(G(z))$. This objective function results in the
same fixed point of the dynamics of G and D but provides much stronger gradients early in learning.

(D, blue, dashed line) so that it discriminates between samples from the data generating distribution (black,
dotted line) px from those of the generative distribution pg (G) (green, solid line). The lower horizontal line is
the domain from which z is sampled, in this case uniformly. The horizontal line above is part of the domain
of x. The upward arrows show how the mapping $x = G(z)$ imposes the non-uniform distribution pg on
transformed samples. G contracts in regions of high density and expands in regions of low density of pg. (a)
Consider an adversarial pair near convergence: $p_g$ is similar to pdata and D is a partially accurate classifier.
(b) In the inner loop of the algorithm D is trained to discriminate samples from data, converging to $D^*(x)= \frac{P_{data}(x)}{P_{data}(x)+P_{g}(x)}$  (c) After an update to G, gradient of D has guided G(z) to flow to regions that are more likely
to be classified as data. (d) After several steps of training, if G and D have enough capacity, they will reach a
point at which both cannot improve because $p_g = p_{data}$. The discriminator is unable to differentiate between
the two distributions, i.e. $D(x) = \frac{1}{2}$

\section{Theoretical Results}

The generator G implicitly defines a probability distribution pg as the distribution of the samples
$G(z)$ obtained when $z \sim p_z$. Therefore, we would like Algorithm 1 to converge to a good estimator
of pdata, if given enough capacity and training time. The results of this section are done in a nonparametric
setting, e.g. we represent a model with infinite capacity by studying convergence in the
space of probability density functions.

\noindent
We will show in section 4.1 that this minimax game has a global optimum for pg = pdata. We will
then show in section 4.2 that Algorithm 1 optimizes Eq 1, thus obtaining the desired result.

\subsection{ Global Optimality of $p_g = p_{data}$}    
We first consider the optimal discriminator D for any given generator G.\\
\textbf{Proposition 1}. \textit{For G fixed, the optimal discriminator D is}

\[
D^*(x)= \frac{P_{data}(x)}{P_{data}(x)+P_{g}(x)}
\]

\textit{Proof}. The training criterion for the discriminator D, given any generator G, is to maximize the quantity $V (G, D)$

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
      V(G, D) & =    \int_{x}^{}  p_{data}(x)log(D(x))\,dx + \int_{z}^{}  p_{z}(z)log(1-D(g(z)))\,dz \\
      & = \int_{x}^{}  p_{data}(x)log(D(x)) + p_{g}(x)log(1-D(g(x)))\,dx
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

For any $(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ \{0, 0\}$, the function 
$y \rightarrow  a log(y) + b log(1 - y)$ 
achieves its maximum in
[0, 1] at $\frac{a}{a+b}$. The discriminator does not need to be defined outside of 
$Supp(p_{data}) \cup Supp(p_g)$,
concluding the proof.
    
\section{Experiments}
We trained adversarial nets an a range of datasets including MNIST[23], the Toronto Face Database
(TFD) [28], and CIFAR-10 [21]. The generator nets used a mixture of rectifier linear activations [19,
9] and sigmoid activations, while the discriminator net used maxout [10] activations. Dropout [17]
was applied in training the discriminator net. While our theoretical framework permits the use of
dropout and other noise at intermediate layers of the generator, we used noise as the input to only
the bottommost layer of the generator network.

We estimate probability of the test set data under pg by fitting a Gaussian Parzen 
window to then samples generated with G and reporting the log-likelihood under 
this distribution. The $\sigma$ parameter

of the Gaussians was obtained by cross validation on the validation set. This procedure was introduced in Breuleux et al. [8] and used for various generative models for which the exact likelihood
is not tractable [25, 3, 5]. Results are reported in Table 1. This method of estimating the likelihood
has somewhat high variance and does not perform well in high dimensional spaces but it is the best
method available to our knowledge. Advances in generative models that can sample but not estimate
likelihood directly motivate further research into how to evaluate such models.

In Figures 2 and 3 we show samples drawn from the generator net after training. While we make no
claim that these samples are better than samples generated by existing methods, we believe that these
samples are at least competitive with the better generative models in the literature and highlight the
potential of the adversarial framework.
